# My own version of Social-Image-Server

This is my own version of Social-Image-Server from [my collabrative project](https://github.com/HUNG-rushb/Images-Social-Server)
In my version, i will perform migraion from Javascript to Typescript and from Apollo Server to GraphQL-yoga

There are 3 main branchs:
+ Branch mirror will be used as branch copy from main branch on original Social-Image-Server using a github action synchronization
+ Branch develop will be used as main for developing and refactoring code
+ Branch main will be used as deployment branch
